Flask API with MongoDB
This is a simple Flask API that allows you to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on a MongoDB database. It is set up to work with a collection called "Hulu" in a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt using pip.
Configuration
1. In PyMongo.py, modify the MongoClient constructor to connect to your own MongoDB cluster. You can obtain the connection string from the Atlas dashboard.
2. In PyMongo.py, change the db variable to the name of the database you want to use.

Usage
1. Run the Flask app by executing python PyMongoDB.py.
2. To add a new movie or show to the database, make a POST request to http://localhost:8080/api with a JSON body containing the data.
3. To update the information of an existing movie or show, make a PATCH request to http://localhost:8080/api/<title> with a JSON body containing the updated data.
4. To delete a movie or show from the database, make a DELETE request to http://localhost:8080/api/<title>.
5. To retrieve all the movies and shows in the database, make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api.
6. To retrieve the details of a specific movie or show, make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/<title>.

Requirements
See requirements.txt for a list of required packages.
Note: The pymongo package is required to connect to MongoDB. You will also need to have a MongoDB Atlas account and a database set up to use this API.
